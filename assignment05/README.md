# Assignment: Equation Parser

![Math equations](https://blog.praxilabs.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Most-Important-Physics-Equations-in-History.jpg)

## Overview

In this assignment you will write a Go code to parse simple equations and test the function(s).  The equations consist of only positive integers, "+", "-", "*", and "/" operators with on both the left and right hand sides of the equation.  White space is allowed.  For example `7 + 2 /3 = 1*3`.  There is no program required for this assignment and therefore no "main" package.

## Learning Objectives

- Software testing including Go Examples, Unit Testing, Benchmark Testing, Fuzz Testing

## Requirements

- Complete the tasks as described in the source code in the project.
- You code will be graded on completeness and form.  So please write comprehensive tests that are well documented and follow the Go conventions.
- **Do not edit any file that has a comment toward the top stating so.**
- Only need to handle positive integers (zero included) in equations.
- The equations need not be valid to be parsable or printable.

- Do not use any library other than the Go standard library.
- The source code must compile with the most recent version of the Go compiler.
- The program must not panic under any circumstances.
- Make sure your code is "gofmt'd".  See "gofmt" or better use "goimports" or better yet configure IDE to do this formatting on file save.
- Commit and push your working code to your GIT repository.

## Hints

- Commit and push often so you do not loose any of your work.
- Use the `Makefile`.  For example, you can run tests with `make test`.  To make sure your code is properly formatted run `make fix`.
